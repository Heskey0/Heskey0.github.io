Hi, I am Heskey Ang Zhao, currently a graduate student at Xiamen University, majoring in computer graphics, with a particular focus on 3D/4D reconstruction. I am working with Prof. [Junfeng Yao](https://cdmc.xmu.edu.cn/info/1010/1062.htm). Additionally, I am honored to have the opportunity to work with Professor [Xiaohu Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Game Design from Communication University of China. I've previously spent wonderful times interning at Tencent IEG(2024) as a technical artist intern, Motphys(2024) working on physics engine development, Xiamen Black Mirror Technology(2022) and Tencent CSIG(2022) as an algorithm engineer intern.

My research interests include:

* **Physically-based Rendering**: more specifically, (deeop) real-time volumetric rendering and material modeling.
* **Physically-based Simulation**: deformable body simulation and cloth simulation.
* **Computer Character Animation**: high-quality motion generation for digital human.
* **Computer Vision**: 3D/4D reconstruction.
