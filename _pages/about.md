# Hi, 👋

I am (Heskey) Ang Zhao, born in 2002, and currently a graduate student of Xiamen University, majoring in computer graphics and 3D vision, with a particular focus on 3D/4D reconstruction/generation. I am currently honored to have the opportunity to work with Professor [Xiaohu Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/) from [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) and [Xiao DONG](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/xiaodong/en) from BNU-HKBU United International College. I also collaborate with [Zhiyang Dou](https://frank-zy-dou.github.io/) from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) closely. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Game Design from Communication University of China. I've previously spent wonderful times interning at [Tencent IEG](https://game.qq.com/web20220628txgame/index.html)(2024)<img src='../images/logo/tencent.png' style='width: 6em;'> and [Metamaker](https://www.metamaker.cn/#/aboutUs)(2022) as a research engineer, [Motphys](https://motphys.com/#/index)(2024) working on physics engine development, [Tencent CSIG](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/)(2022) <img src='../images/logo/tencent.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a software engineer intern.

My research interests include:

* **<font color=MediumBlue>Physically-based Rendering</font>**: more specifically, (deep) real-time volumetric rendering and material modeling.
* **<font color=MediumBlue>Physically-based Simulation</font>**: deformable body simulation and cloth simulation.
* **<font color=MediumBlue>Computer Character Animation</font>**: high-quality motion generation/control for digital humans.
* **<font color=MediumBlue>Computer Vision</font>**: 3D/4D reconstruction/generation.
