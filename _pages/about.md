# Hi, ðŸ‘‹

I am (Heskey) Ang Zhao, currently a graduate student at [Center for Digital Media Computing](https://cdmc.xmu.edu.cn/en/Team.htm) of Xiamen University, majoring in computer graphics and 3D vision, with a particular focus on 3D/4D reconstruction. I am honored to have the opportunity to work with Professor [Xiaohu Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/). I also collaborate with [Zhiyang Dou](https://frank-zy-dou.github.io/) from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) closely. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Game Design from Communication University of China. I've previously spent wonderful times interning at [Tencent IEG](https://game.qq.com/web20220628txgame/index.html)(2024)<img src='../images/logo/tencent.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a technical artist intern, [Motphys](https://motphys.com/#/index)(2024) working on physics engine development, [Xiamen Black Mirror Technology](https://www.metamaker.cn/#/aboutUs)(2022) and [Tencent CSIG](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/)(2022) <img src='../images/logo/tencent.png' style='width: 6em;'> as an algorithm engineer intern.

My research interests include:

* **<font color=MediumBlue>Physically-based Rendering</font>**: more specifically, (deep) real-time volumetric rendering and material modeling.
* **<font color=MediumBlue>Physically-based Simulation</font>**: deformable body simulation and cloth simulation.
* **<font color=MediumBlue>Computer Character Animation</font>**: high-quality motion generation for digital human.
* **<font color=MediumBlue>Computer Vision</font>**: 3D/4D reconstruction.
